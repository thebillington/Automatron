		<h1>Play</h1>
		
		<p>Do you enjoy solving problems?</p>
		
		<p>Automatron is a game all about solving problems. However, there is so much you can do that it can get a <i>little</i> confusing, which is why we have put together this <a href="instructions.html">handy little guide</a> that explains all of the rules and how to play. It might look daunting, but jumping into Automatron will be some of the most fun you've had this year. This means our instruction booklet is well worth a read!</p>
		
		<p>In Automatron you create workers or 'automatrons' to help you run the factory floor. Each worker has a specific route they have to follow that you give them. You must pay attention to detail to ensure that all of your workers are doing the right thing, as if there is one thing out of place then the whole machine could fall to pieces!</p>

		<h1>Solve</h1>
		
		<p>Do you think you have what it takes to be a programmer?</p>
		
		<p>At the heart of Automatron is problem solving. "You have to get each of your packages to the correct goal in order to win the level?" Sounds simple right? But what happens when you have multiple packages spawning into the same location, destined for different goals? Now you're talking!</p>
		
		<p>Better put that thinking cap on because once you've learned how to play, it's time to jump into our <a href="browser.php?t=campaign">campaign!</a></p>
